                    On January 20, 2025, the Cuban government launched a cryptocurrency, claiming it would revolutionize the nation's financial future. For a brief moment, it seemed like hope had arrived for the Cuban people. The coin skyrocketed to a $30 million market cap, and investors believed change was within reach.

                  <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-white">
                    But in a cruel twist, the project collapsed just hours later in a devastating rug pull. It wasn't just a financial loss—it was a betrayal of trust. The government's failed attempt left the Cuban people disillusioned and abandoned. And yet, the story didn't end there.

                  <p className="text-lg mb-6 text-white">
                    $CUBA is more than just a meme coin—it's a revolutionary movement and
                    the first-ever 'Country Takeover' (CTO).

                    Sparked by the Cuban government's failed attempts to launch a
                    cryptocurrency—and the bold response of a global community—$CUBA is
                    on a mission to empower the Cuban people and achieve true financial
                    independence.

                    $CUBA bridges the gap between digital assets and humanitarian
                    initiatives, supporting the Cuban community worldwide while
                    amplifying their voices and aspirations for freedom.
