                    On January 20, 2025, the Cuban government launched a cryptocurrency, claiming it would revolutionize the nation's financial future. For a brief moment, it seemed like hope had arrived for the Cuban people. The coin skyrocketed to a $30 million market cap, and investors believed change was within reach.

                  <p className="text-lg mt-6 text-white">
                    But in a cruel twist, the project collapsed just hours later in a devastating rug pull. It wasn't just a financial lossâ€”it was a betrayal of trust. The government's failed attempt left the Cuban people disillusioned and abandoned. And yet, the story didn't end there.
